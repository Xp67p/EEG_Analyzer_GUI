EEG Open vs Closed Eyes – Signals & Systems Project

This project analyzes EEG signals recorded in **eyes-open** and **eyes-closed** conditions.

Goals:
- Load multi-channel EEG data
- Focus on occipital channels (O1, Oz, O2)
- Apply digital band-pass filters to extract:
  - Delta (0.5–4 Hz)
  - Theta (4–8 Hz)
  - Alpha (8–13 Hz)
  - Beta (13–30 Hz)
  - Gamma (30–45 Hz)
- Compare band power for open vs closed eyes
