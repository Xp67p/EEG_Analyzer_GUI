Project For Signals & Systems Course.

Involves analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals by separating them into their standard frequency bands and examining each band’s characteristic.
Uses digital filters or spectral analysis (FFT/Power Spectral Density) to isolate these bands from EEG recordings. By quantifying the signal
power or activity in each band, we can infer conditions such as relaxation (e.g. increased alpha
waves) or sleep stages (dominant delta waves).
